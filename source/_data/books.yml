  summary: >
    The moon blows up and dooms the Earth. Humanity (at basically our same technological level) has about two years to figure out how to keep the race going in space. An Odssey of science, tragedy, and survival ensues.
  notes: >
    I love this book. It single-handedly reignited my love for science fiction and reminded me why fiction is essential fuel for the imagination.
    Once I started reading, this book filled every waking moment for about a week. It falls under 'Hard Science Fiction', which just means
    it maintains a high standard for scientific rigor, so everything either is already possible or mostly theoretically sound.
    Stephenson, who worked at Blue Origin, is in fact so rigorous that it can feel impossible to *unsuspend* disbelief. Can't recommend enough; bonus if
    you're looking for something with whip-crack smart, well-written female leads.
