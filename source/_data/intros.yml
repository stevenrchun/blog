  <p><b>Hello, I'm Steven Chun. This is my blog.</b> It exists <i>mostly</i> as a research notebook
  for topics in computer science, statistics, and economics. It exists <i>partly</i> so I can shout my nonsense into the void.
  If you're curious about my current affiliations, see <a href="http://www.stevenchun.me">my homepage.</a></p>

  <p><b>This is my bookshelf.</b> It is simply a semi-up-to-date list of the books I own, many of which I haven't read.
  I unabashedly ripped off this concept from <a href="https://patrickcollison.com/bookshelf">Patrick Collison</a>.
   <i>"I believe that, confronted by a vast array of books, <b>anyone</b> will be seized by the anguish of learning,
  and will inevitably lapse into asking the question that expresses his torment and his remorse"</i> - Umberto Eco. Welp, that's the idea.</p>
