  <p><b>Hello, I'm Steven Chun. This is my blog.</b> It exists <i>mostly</i> as a research notebook
  for topics in computer science, statistics, and economics. It exists <i>partly</i> so I can shout my nonsense into the void.
  If you're curious about my current affiliations, see <a href="http://www.stevenchun.me">my homepage.</a></p>

  <p><b>This is a bookshelf.</b> It's a dump of text I liked and would recommend to a friend. Many of my best recommendations are not books but rather newsletters or other blogs.
   Texts that are publicly available on the internet have a special gold border. </p>
