    <p>Say you’re Amazon. You have a lot of money, even in a pandemic, and since you’re
Amazon, you hate having money. So you consider buying an entertainment company,
to complement things like Prime video. Maybe you have some secret talks about
buying AMC, the entertainment company.</p>
<p>But these things leak. The Daily Mail reported as much on <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/markets/article-8303833/Could-Amazon-local-cinema.html" class="docMetadata" data-popup-title="Could Amazon be about to take over your local cinema?" data-popup-image="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/05/09/20/28203792-0-image-a-170_1589052332977.jpg" data-popup-abstract="Sources said Amazon, run by billionaire Jeff Bezos, has run the rule over America's AMC Theatres, the world's largest cinema chain, which also owns Odeon in the UK." target="_blank" rel="nooponer external">May 9th
</a>. It’s a little
unclear who the sources are nor whether the talks are even still active. But
even under uncertainty, talk of Amazon acquiring a business that is otherwise
hurting pretty badly is enough to basically double its stock price.</p>
<p>One small hitch is that no one was actually sure which AMC Amazon was talking
about buying.</p>
<p><img src="https://media1.tenor.com/images/0e48d9c822b64bf8ad32e24080b1d17f/tenor.gif" alt="Which one? Silicon Valley gif"></p>
<p>The Daily Mail article identified AMC Theatres, the cinema company. But there’s
also AMC Networks, which owns shows like the Walking Dead. Both are in the
business of entertainment, but one has stuff that people might want to stream
and the other a bunch of empty movie theaters. Three days after the Daily Mail
article, a CFTN article claimed two inside sources that said the subject of the
talks was AMC Networks, not Theatres. Bloomberg’s Matt Levine points out<label for="fd690117a4b63cc93ff557b7fd22d6ff86e6101ab40359547e4c2b600d9a895b" class="sidenote-number margin-toggle"></label><input type="checkbox" class="margin-toggle" id="fd690117a4b63cc93ff557b7fd22d6ff86e6101ab40359547e4c2b600d9a895b"><span class="sidenote"> Was the first to point out, in fact, to me, via newsletter.

</a>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“Yes but while AMC Networks makes more sense than AMC Entertainment as an Amazon
acquisition target, AMC Entertainment has one crucial advantage, which is that
its ticker is AMC. If the rumor you hear is “Amazon is buying AMC,” your first
reaction might be “I need to buy some AMC stock,” and so you go buy the stock of
a company whose name and ticker are AMC. And then AMC Entertainment stock goes
up. Someone else hears “Amazon is buying AMC” and notices that the stock whose
ticker is AMC is spiking, and so they are quite sure that the AMC that Amazon is
buying is AMC Entertainment. So they buy AMC Entertainment, its price spikes
more, and the rumor gains momentum. Meanwhile, AMCX, what is AMCX, Amazon is
buying AMC, not AMCX.”

<p>This is all very funny to me. Financial markets are by general public
perception, serious, complicated matters. But this isn’t; this is very silly.

<p>Or, in our case, the application of fancy econometric models to measuring the
impact of goofs in the financial markets.</p>
<p>To be clear, what I’m about to do I first read about <a href="https://www.alexpghayes.com/blog/elon-musk-send-tweet/" class="docMetadata" data-popup-title="synthetic control: elon's tweet tanked tesla's stock" data-popup-image="" data-popup-abstract="" target="_blank" rel="nooponer external">here
</a>.
Alex Hayes, a PhD candidate at UW-Madison, applied a Bayesian Synthetic Control
approach “to estimate the causal impact of Musk’s tweet on the Tesla stock price
(God I hate that I just wrote that sentence).” The tweet in question was the
infamous <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1256239815256797184" class="docMetadata" data-popup-title="twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1256239815256797184" data-popup-image="" data-popup-abstract="" target="_blank" rel="nooponer external">“Tesla stock price too high imo”
</a> which was responsible for
about a $40 drop in Tesla’s price.</p>
<p>Anyway, I decided this was a good bit and an even more interesting econometric
technique and filed both away to regurgitate here should the opportunity arise.</p>
<h2 id="Synthetic-Controls"><a href="#Synthetic-Controls" class="headerlink" title="Synthetic Controls"></a>Synthetic Controls</h2><p>The original synthetic control method (SCM) was introduced by <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w8478" class="docMetadata" data-popup-title="The Economic Costs of Conflict: A Case-Control Study for the Basque Country" data-popup-image="" data-popup-abstract="Founded in 1920, the NBER is a private, non-profit, non-partisan organization dedicated to conducting economic research and to disseminating research findings among academics, public policy makers, and business professionals." target="_blank" rel="nooponer external">Abadie and Gardeazabal (2003)
</a> to study the impact of conflict—in this case, terrorism by the Basque
seperatist group Euskadi Ta Askatasuna<label for="03483d7c4fb3331e766007c55d612cce80cf91ee5c54f6f8a2ff85401b11fe82" class="sidenote-number margin-toggle"></label><input type="checkbox" class="margin-toggle" id="03483d7c4fb3331e766007c55d612cce80cf91ee5c54f6f8a2ff85401b11fe82"><span class="sidenote"> If you’re wondering why a Basque seperatist group, Basque Country being a
region of Spain, has a name that’s nowhere close to Spanish, it’s because <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basque_language" class="docMetadata" data-popup-title="Basque language - Wikipedia" data-popup-image="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Euskalkiak.svg/1200px-Euskalkiak.svg.png" data-popup-abstract="" target="_blank" rel="nooponer external">Basque is a language

</span>—on the economy. Causal
analysis is practically about measuring what has happened and estimating what
the world might be like if it hadn’t happened. Obviously, observing the latter,
the counterfactual, is impossible. You can’t go back in time, stop the
terrorists, and then see what happens to the economy<label for="3421eed1f574049968d687358e10b7da986857ad72edf40814a2e2d8105e0935" class="sidenote-number margin-toggle"></label><input type="checkbox" class="margin-toggle" id="3421eed1f574049968d687358e10b7da986857ad72edf40814a2e2d8105e0935"><span class="sidenote"> If you’re interested in this screenplay, however, my email is at

</span>. Generally, the next
best thing is randomized controlled trials. Scientific experiments, basically.
You have a population that’s roughly representative, and you randomly treat some
of them and measure the impact. But practical and ethical considerations prevent
you from randomly doing terrorism to people.</p>
<p>So we’re left with observational studies that attempt to tease out the causal
relationship by finding natural experiments and making careful arguments about
the right controls. These can be hard to do, though, when your variable of
interest is something as complicated and many-faceted as the economic wellbeing
of a region distinctly different from others around it. The classic approach is
a diff-in-diff analysis. Famous examples of this are <a href="http://davidcard.berkeley.edu/papers/mariel-impact.pdf" class="docMetadata" data-popup-title="davidcard.berkeley.edu/papers/mariel-impact.pdf" data-popup-image="" data-popup-abstract="" target="_blank" rel="nooponer external">Card (1990)
</a>, studying the impact of the Mariel Boatlift on Miami’s labor
market, and <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w4509" class="docMetadata" data-popup-title="Minimum Wages and Employment: A Case Study of the Fast Food Industry in New Jersey and Pennsylvania" data-popup-image="" data-popup-abstract="Founded in 1920, the NBER is a private, non-profit, non-partisan organization dedicated to conducting economic research and to disseminating research findings among academics, public policy makers, and business professionals." target="_blank" rel="nooponer external">Card and Krueger

Classics, absolute bangers.</p>
<p>So Abadie and Gadeazabal said, “what if we don’t need to find a region that
looks just like Basque Country, what if we built one with math?” So they built a
synthetic control of Basque Country. Basically, you pick some similar but
different regions that exhibit similar economic trends to Basque Country. You
can then use pre-treatment data to build a model of Basque Country as a weighted
average of these other regions. Use this model to estimate a counterfactual of
the post-treatment period; do your causal analysis.</p>
<p>There are a few problems with this. A lot of it comes down to not really knowing
how well you’ve actually modeled Basque Country. Traditional SCMs don’t indicate
their uncertainty via something like confidence intervals, and so your model
might be garbage and you don’t know it. There’s also the typical problem of
overfitting to the pre-treatment data.</p>
<h2 id="Bayesian-Synthetic-Controls"><a href="#Bayesian-Synthetic-Controls" class="headerlink" title="Bayesian Synthetic Controls"></a>Bayesian Synthetic Controls</h2><p>In order to improve on some of the aforementioned shortcomings of SCMs, a team
at Google<label for="fcd8ce91bf4aaa021822fe50d67cb37fbaa879b9f21cc37cb735d0a50cb8addf" class="sidenote-number margin-toggle"></label><input type="checkbox" class="margin-toggle" id="fcd8ce91bf4aaa021822fe50d67cb37fbaa879b9f21cc37cb735d0a50cb8addf"><span class="sidenote"> Disclaimer: I work at Google, but I was not

</a>. The skinny of it is instead of just using a weighted average,
they use a Bayesian structural time-series model. I really don’t have a good
intuition for what’s going on here, but I’ll leave you with this from <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.00356.pdf" class="docMetadata" data-popup-title="arxiv.org/pdf/1506.00356.pdf" data-popup-image="" data-popup-abstract="" target="_blank" rel="nooponer external">Brodersen et al. 2015

<blockquote>
<p>
“We combine the three preceding sources of information [time series data of the
pre-treatment object of interest, the behavior of other time-series predictive
of your object of interest, and prior knowledge about the object of interest]
using a state-space time-series model, where one component of state is a linear
regression on the contemporaneous predictors. The framework of our model allows
us to choose from among a large set of potential controls by placing a
spike-and-slab prior on the set of regression coefficients and by allowing the
model to average over the set of controls (George and McCulloch , 1997). We then
compute the posterior distribution of the counterfactual time series given the
value of the target series in the pre-intervention period, along with the values
of the controls in the post-intervention period. Subtracting the predicted from
the observed response during the post-intervention period gives a semiparametric
Bayesian posterior distribution for the causal effect”
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>I think the reason I don’t really understand this is that I don’t
understand the whole Frequentist vs. Bayesian thing nor do I have much intuition
for what a prior is. Generally, though, instead of the weighted average approach
to SCM, they seem to be using a model more akin to a Markov Chain or
something<label for="0199643bbbbc92cd1eb73297a696040142aa87336218d7d84b4a74e181f7c9a4" class="sidenote-number margin-toggle"></label><input type="checkbox" class="margin-toggle" id="0199643bbbbc92cd1eb73297a696040142aa87336218d7d84b4a74e181f7c9a4"><span class="sidenote">A better understanding of Bayesian statistics is en route whenever I get around to it.
</span>.</p>
<p>Normally, I’m loathe to use a model I don’t fully understand, but Google
published their work as a super easy to use R package (which someone then
converted to a super easy to use python package), and it really works well for
the bit.</p>
<h2 id="The-Question"><a href="#The-Question" class="headerlink" title="The Question"></a>The Question</h2><p><em>How Much of AMC Theater’s Price Increase can we Attribute to a (Potential)

<p>We’re going to be doing a really quick-n-dirty causal analysis here. Like, smash
and grab. I have other things to do<label for="ada1e1b25ae31a27c012a90397e5c89c1444323922e830471fa8c132dae202e6" class="sidenote-number margin-toggle"></label><input type="checkbox" class="margin-toggle" id="ada1e1b25ae31a27c012a90397e5c89c1444323922e830471fa8c132dae202e6"><span class="sidenote">Not true.
</span>.</p>
<p>We’re going to use the SP&amp; 500 to build our synthetic control for AMC. The idea
here is that the S&amp;P 500 should reflect any general macroeconomic effects that
might affect AMC. There’s a glaring problem here, which is that Amazon is in the
S&amp;P 500 and so if the announced talks between Amazon and AMC increase both their
stock prices, this will bias our effect downward. Also, the S&amp;P 500 isn’t very
predictive on the intraday trading of any one firm. Oh well.</p>
<p>I pull about two weeks of price data at ten minute intervals for AMC and VOO,
the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 index.</p>
<p>The article ran on a Sunday, so we partition the data so that the pre-treatment
data ends on the Friday before the article. Then, we just give Causal Impact the
data.</p>
<p>Here’s what it spits out:</p>
<div class="large-figure"><p><img src="./ci.png" alt="Causal Impact graphs"></p>
</div>


<p>Since I indexed our data using a Pandas date object, we see the times when the
market is closed as straight lines between the actual data. You can see from the
point effects panel, that the pre-treatment effect, which we’d like to be zero,
is fine-ish. It bounces around a bit, but generally hovers around zero. Like I
mentioned before, the S&amp;P 500 is a huge thing with a lot of inertia that isn’t
going to help explain intraday AMC trading much—even though it’ll capture rough
days on the market in general. One thing we might’ve done is used another
cinema-owning company to help capture intraday trends better. It might also bias
our estimate upwards, however, if people expect an Amazon owned AMC to smash its
competitors, and so people start selling or shorting Cinemark stock or
something.</p>
<p>A nice thing to see is the confidence interval growing in the cumulative effect
panel. The further out our model interpolates<label for="1d3f3328e9f89d8f381623174f3d8b31bf49b509692ed8deafe729df953a9700" class="sidenote-number margin-toggle"></label><input type="checkbox" class="margin-toggle" id="1d3f3328e9f89d8f381623174f3d8b31bf49b509692ed8deafe729df953a9700"><span class="sidenote"> I know what I said. Because our model is using post-treatment data from the
control time series to estimate the post-treatment counterfactual, we’re
actually interpolating rather than extrapolating. This is another nice benefit
of SCMs.
</span>, the less certain we should be.</p>
<p>Causal Impact also gives us a sense of the shape of the effect, which a lot of
methods won’t get you. We can see the uncertainty about the initial report kick
in and the initial excitement about AMC Theaters decay.</p>
<p>Interpreting this as a single descriptive statistic is a little tricky. For a
lot of metrics, you might add up the pointwise impact across the post-treatment
period. This is a little odd for a stock price, which isn’t like revenue, where
you can say, “oh look we made X amount of money over Y days because of the
treatment”. You can think of it this way: If you owned a bunch of AMC stock, and
every ten minutes that the markets were open, you sold exactly one share, and
you did this the Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday after the Daily Mail story
broke, you would have made 981.57 dollars. This model predicts that if people
hadn’t read that Amazon might buy AMC,  you would’ve probably made somewhere
between 683 and 881 dollars.</p>
<p>Is that super useful? Not really, but then again what are we measuring here?
We’re measuring the market’s valuation of AMC under the belief and ensuing
uncertainty that Amazon might want to buy it. Nothing, of course, actually
changed about AMC. People’s expectations of future value changed, and that was
then incorporated into the price of AMC. You could’ve turned that belief into
real money if you sold a bunch on Monday. But after a few days, people realized
their belief about AMC might’ve been a goof, and so the price increase,
representing that belief, largely evaporated. AMC doesn’t get to keep it.</p>
<p>Stock prices over time are little like Santa’s sleigh that runs on Christmas
cheer. You can turn cheer into flight at any given moment, but if on Christmas
Eve, all that cheer evaporates because Connecticut Financial News<label for="29ce4747825b9777137f06932321ef46647224e35041cf11ac53b09ad7ce5059" class="sidenote-number margin-toggle"></label><input type="checkbox" class="margin-toggle" id="29ce4747825b9777137f06932321ef46647224e35041cf11ac53b09ad7ce5059"><span class="sidenote">Which, it turns out, is what CTFN stands for.

that this whole Christmas thing was, in fact, a mixup and we need to be doing
wacky Yule stuff to celebrate the Wild Hunt, then tough luck.</p>
<p>The Causal Impact package very nicely generates a report for you, so you read
this and see if you can come up with a better freakin analogy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
During the post-intervention period, the response variable had
an average value of approx. 4.93254. By contrast, in the absence of an
intervention, we would have expected an average response of 3.91743.
The 95% interval of this counterfactual prediction is [3.43472, 4.4284].
Subtracting this prediction from the observed response yields
an estimate of the causal effect the intervention had on the
response variable. This effect is 1.0151 with a 95% interval of
[0.50414, 1.49782]. For a discussion of the significance of this effect,
see below.


<p>Summing up the individual data points during the post-intervention
period (which can only sometimes be meaningfully interpreted), the
response variable had an overall value of 981.575.
By contrast, had the intervention not taken place, we would have expected
a sum of 779.56923. The 95% interval of this prediction is [683.50915, 881.251].</p>
<p>The above results are given in terms of absolute numbers. In relative
terms, the response variable showed an increase of +25.91249%. The 95%
interval of this percentage is [12.86916%, 38.23469%].</p>
<p>This means that the positive effect observed during the intervention
period is statistically significant and unlikely to be due to random
fluctuations. It should be noted, however, that the question of whether
this increase also bears substantive significance can only be answered
by comparing the absolute effect (1.0151) to the original goal
of the underlying intervention.</p>
<p>The probability of obtaining this effect by chance is very small
(Bayesian one-sided tail-area probability p = 0.0).
This means the causal effect can be considered statistically
significant.</p>

<p><em>06/24/20 - Update: I realized CausalImpact was setting a prior standard
deviation that was probably too low for this data (again, firing from the hip
here. Not well versed in these sorts of models). The package has an option to
allow the model to pick the standard deviation itself, which generates much more
reasonable looking credible intervals. I have updated the report and the graph
and any other numbers that were sourced from that analysis. Thanks to B. Hie for
the catch.</em></p>
