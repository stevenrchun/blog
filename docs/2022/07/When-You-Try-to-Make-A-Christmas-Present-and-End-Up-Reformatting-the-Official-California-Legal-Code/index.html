the leadership of the California State Assembly and Senate and made a lot of
wonks and lawyers very happy.</p>
<p><img src="winter-1890.jpg" alt="An oil painting of forest, heavily blanketed in snow. A morning or evening

<h2 id="Yuletide-Blues"><a href="#Yuletide-Blues" class="headerlink" title="Yuletide Blues"></a>Yuletide Blues</h2><p>Twas the Christmas Break of 2021, and the Chun siblings once again sat under
their childhood roof, nursing coffee and speaking of their woes.</p>
<p>“Well I’m a law student, see”, said my brother, “and it is this website that
vexes me.” “The laws of California are lacking in indentation / Might you write
some code to save me this consternation?”</p>
<p>He flipped his laptop around,
<a href="http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/" class="docMetadata" data-popup-title="California Legislative Information" data-popup-image="" data-popup-abstract="" target="_blank" rel="nooponer external">leginfo.legislature.ca.gov

browser, and here’s what I saw<label for="5f5386d0edd874255be775e384e70504c309813217f09ab21128ce784298fc7b" class="sidenote-number margin-toggle"></label><input type="checkbox" class="margin-toggle" id="5f5386d0edd874255be775e384e70504c309813217f09ab21128ce784298fc7b"><span class="sidenote">Dramatic reenactment.</span>:</p>
<div class="large-figure"><p><img src="bad.png" alt="A wall of laws with no indentation." title="boooooooooooooooo"></p>
</div>

<p>This is bad. I think it’s obvious to everyone that laws</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">a. should</span><br><span class="line">  1. be</span><br><span class="line">  2. written</span><br><span class="line">    A. like</span><br><span class="line">  3. this,</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">b) and</span><br><span class="line">1i) not</span><br><span class="line">ii) like</span><br><span class="line">c) this</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>I count at least five layers of subsections entirely left aligned. Not a tab in
sight. Figuring out which provision a subheading falls under requires manually
backtracking, noting which heading level you are at, until you find a top level
heading.</p>
<p>The insanity this formatting induces has a delayed onset. On first pass you go,
“whoa that’s bad haha”. Then you try to find something–it grates you a little.
And then with each successive search your vision begins to blur, your will
weakens as this unforgiving wall of text rapidly destabilizes your humors, black
bile oozing from your ears.</p>
<p>My brother and his colleagues in law had taken to pasting the relevant codes
into Microsoft Word and adding indentation manually. To give you a sense of
scale, if you were to do that for <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=GOV&division=1.&title=7.&part=&chapter=3.&article=10.6." class="docMetadata" data-popup-title="Codes Display Text" data-popup-image="" data-popup-abstract="" target="_blank" rel="nooponer external"> Title 7, Division 1, Chapter 3, Article 10.6
The Housing Elements 
</a>,
you would be manually indenting 1603 individual codes. Assuming an average
heading depth of even just 2 or 3, we’re talking about hitting the TAB button
thousands of times.</p>
<h3 id="I’m-In"><a href="#I’m-In" class="headerlink" title="I’m In"></a>I’m In</h3><p>This seemed like a fairly simple project. I could just write a Chrome Extension
to add margin based on where we were in the heading structure. Luckily, the
alphabets used for each level of heading are consistent–they always<label for="c74f288325d915c38908ef9cda00fd023712bc9216bfee364b45c897b3aa80c8" class="sidenote-number margin-toggle"></label><input type="checkbox" class="margin-toggle" id="c74f288325d915c38908ef9cda00fd023712bc9216bfee364b45c897b3aa80c8"><span class="sidenote">Mostly.

<p>Brother Chun is also part of several Slacks that are all vaguely related to
housing advocacy. Like a Minecraft server for housing wonks. He posted the

<p>It was only then that I realized how long the specter of lost indentation had
haunted the civically active in California.</p>

<p>In which I was identified as “some YIMBY volunteers” which is not incorrect as
I would like to see more housing built in my San Francisco neighborhood, and I
contain multitudes.</p>
<p>However, if housing twitter finds this please–and this is key–<strong>do not hurt

<p>But this got even more amazing reactions! Like this one:</p>

I can see why people do it. It’s also easier than
<em>being</em> famous. I had maybe 150 people who I don’t know like a tweet where I was
the vague focal point, and yet there I was, kerosene  in my veins. Things had
somewhat settled when I got a Twitter DM from known elected official <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Lee_(politician)" class="docMetadata" data-popup-title="Alex Lee (politician) - Wikipedia" data-popup-image="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/CA_Assembly_Alex_Lee.jpg" data-popup-abstract="" target="_blank" rel="nooponer external"> Alex

<p>Assemblyman Lee was extremely nice, thanking me for making the Chrome Extension

and now could use my work as a proof of concept!</p>
<p>In the Bay Area adjacent Twitter circles I follow (as I type this, the bags
under my eyes darken noticeably, a sort of curling monkey paw, a reminder of the
price one pays to feel marginally adjacent to happening things) Alex Lee is a
big deal. It suffices to say that he seems widely liked by the Bay’s famously
fractious liberal facets with his eye on the right issues<label for="0e630e1e0567b617c369692924c98874364a841551d39dfce6f6ec2dcd7de252" class="sidenote-number margin-toggle"></label><input type="checkbox" class="margin-toggle" id="0e630e1e0567b617c369692924c98874364a841551d39dfce6f6ec2dcd7de252"><span class="sidenote">I encourage the reader to look up his Social Housing Bill. Unfortunately, it died in committee. But if you care about housing, the bill felt like a real shot at doing things differently, beyond the incrementalism that is so innate to the field.</span>.</p>
<p>A bit later a Google Form circulated among various civic groups, where people
could write in to detail how they had been personally victimized by Leginfo’s
lack of indentation. I filled it in, basically saying, “I don’t actually read the
law very often but hoo boy lotta people seem to have this issue.”</p>
<p>A couple of months later, my brother forwarded me an email. An advocacy group
he’s part of had received a communique from Lee’s chief of staff. With the sign
off of the Speaker and Pro Temp of both houses, Lee’s office had managed to push
through an initiative to reformat the website. They had used my extension to
help demonstrate how much easier it is to read indented bills and to clarify
what exactly it was that they were asking for.</p>
<p>I loaded up leginfo.legislature.ca.gov and there it was: Indentation too cheap
to meter. No need to trigger any exciting…<em>but refined</em> CSS transitions to turn
on better formatting.</p>
<p>I’m pretty certain Lee’s office was going to get this done regardless of whether
a programmer released a Chrome Extension showing roughly how it might be done.</p>
<p>But I like to think I helped.<label for="9c69198c8483146bb91b44139b447f74fe813e6477da71327c9e432932166a1a" class="sidenote-number margin-toggle"></label><input type="checkbox" class="margin-toggle" id="9c69198c8483146bb91b44139b447f74fe813e6477da71327c9e432932166a1a"><span class="sidenote">More entrepreneurial folk than I might attempt to draw morsels of thought leadership from this experience, “10 Lessons from a Successful Civic Coding Project” or “Building for the User: What Weird Things Do Lawyers Hate”.

     I looked at the tutorial for making a Chrome extension a couple times over the course of a month or two before slapping it together over three nights.</p>

     Later measurements would put the figure at just over 500 weekly active users who found a use for this thing  over the lifetime of the project. I like to think that these people are also unreasonably effective agents of change and that hopefully none of them utilized their newfound powers of legibility to push for bad policy.</p>

     Yes In My Backyard.

This suggestion is an act of kindness; all I ask in return is that if you like where you live, really try to warm yourself to the idea that others deserve to live there just as much as you.</p>

     Actually mostly feature requests, new pages on the website that I hadn’t yet added rules for parsing. I’m really quite pleased to report that the extension itself had surprisingly few sharp edges.</p>
